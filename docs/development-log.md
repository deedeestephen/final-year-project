# Development Log

## 2026-09-23 — Phase 0: Project analysis

**Objective:** Understand the specification and environment, and produce the planning documents. No application code yet.

**Inputs analysed**
- Research proposal (docx → text in `docs/source/research-proposal.txt`): 12 use cases, FR-01–FR-12, NFR-01–NFR-11,
  six-layer architecture, AI modules, RAG chatbot, ethics framework, testing plan.
- Two candidate design systems (`docs/design/`).

**Environment discovered (Windows 11)**
| Tool | Version | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Flutter / Dart | 3.35.2 / 3.9.0 | `flutter --version` / `flutter doctor` hung for over 3 min; investigate in Phase 1 |
| Android SDK | present | |
| Java | Temurin JDK 25 | Android Gradle may need JDK 17/21; check in Phase 1 |
| Node | 24.15.0 | OK for NestJS |
| Python | 3.14.5 | Some ML wheels (PyTorch) may lag 3.14; plan a 3.12 venv/container for ai-services |
| Git | 2.51 | |
| Docker | **missing** | Blocks Phase 2 (Postgres, Mongo, Redis, MinIO, Qdrant) |
| gh CLI | missing | Optional |

**Files created:** architecture.md, development-plan.md, requirements-traceability.md, testing-strategy.md,
security.md, ADR-001/002/003, this log.

**Decisions:** Flutter (ADR-001, owner). Design Option 2 with Option 1 legibility rules (ADR-002, proposed).
NestJS + FastAPI (ADR-003, proposed).

**Tests:** none yet (documentation phase).

**Unresolved:** Docker install; confirmation of ADR-002/003; whether a paid LLM API may be used for the chatbot;
GitHub repository for cloud sessions.

**Next:** Phase 1, repository skeleton, docker-compose, CI, smoke tests.

## 2026-09-23 — Phase 1: Repository and development environment

**Objective:** Monorepo skeleton, dev environment config, CI, a quality gate, and a first automated test in each package.

**Context:** The project moved to `C:\Users\deede\OneDrive\Desktop\Final Year Project\pca-mhealth` (owner request). Parts of
this phase (ai-services `app/main.py`, `.env.example`, `infrastructure/docker-compose.yml`, `scripts/quality-gate.*`,
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the mobile placeholder app) were written by a parallel Claude session. They were reviewed by the lead
session and accepted with the fixes below. Going forward, one lead session owns this folder.

**Toolchain:** Flutter pointed at Android Studio Quail 2026.1.3 (`Android Studio3`) and its bundled JDK 25.0.2
(`flutter config --android-studio-dir/--jdk-dir`). JDK 25 needs Gradle ≥ 9.1, so `mobile/android` uses Gradle 9.1.0 (bin),
AGP 8.13.0 and Kotlin 2.2.20 instead of the Flutter 3.35 template defaults (Gradle 8.12 / AGP 8.9.1 / Kotlin 2.1.0).

**Files created:** `backend/` (NestJS 11: `configure-app.ts` with `/api` prefix + URI versioning, `modules/health`),
`ai-services/` (FastAPI, `/v1/health` reporting `development-mock`), `mobile/` (Flutter, org `zm.ac.zcas`), `.env.example`,
`infrastructure/docker-compose.yml` (Postgres 16, Mongo 7, Redis 7, MinIO, Qdrant; localhost-only ports),
`scripts/quality-gate.sh|.ps1`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

**Tests:** backend 2 unit + 3 e2e; ai-services 2; mobile 1 widget test.

**Errors and fixes**
| Problem | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `flutter doctor` hung | Flutter's global lock was held by an Android Studio `flutter create` | Stopped only our own waiting process |
| Gradle wrapper download aborted | Network drop on the large `-all` zip | Switched to `gradle-9.1.0-bin` |
| Jest "Failed to write coverage reports" | Space in "Final Year Project" became `%20` in the HTML report's paths | Reporters set to text/json-summary/lcovonly |
| No coverage enforcement | Jest had no threshold | Added global 80% threshold (NFR-07). It exposed an untested `configure-app.ts`, now unit-tested (100%) |
| pip-audit: 4 CVEs | Outdated `pip` bundled in the venv | Upgraded pip; CI upgrades pip before install |
| Caches would be committed | `.gitignore` gaps | Ignored mypy/ruff/pytest caches, egg-info, `var/`, Gradle files |
| Floating image tags | `minio:latest`, `qdrant:latest` | Pinned versions |

**Quality gate:** backend PASS (format, lint, types, unit + e2e, build, npm audit 0 vulns). ai-services PASS (ruff, mypy
strict, pytest 100% coverage, pip-audit). mobile PASS (format, analyze, widget test, `flutter build apk --debug` in 318 s with JDK 25 + Gradle 9.1).

**Known non-blocking issues**
- Only Python 3.14 is installed. PyTorch and other ML wheels may need 3.12 (CI already uses 3.12); revisit in Phase 11.
- Starlette deprecation warning (httpx TestClient). Harmless for now; revisit when upgrading test tooling.
- gitleaks isn't installed locally (it runs in CI).
- The project lives under OneDrive, so exclude `node_modules`, `.venv`, `build`, `.dart_tool` from sync, or expect lock errors.
- Docker is not installed. **Blocks Phase 2.**

**Next:** Phase 2, database foundation (needs Docker Desktop).
